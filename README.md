# Xtr3d Challenge
We provide OpenCV tutorials on how to utilize ubiquitous Computer Vision algorithms along with a general pythonic infrastructure and a rudimentary python game to test it. **Your job is to implement a simple Natural User Interface engine**.

</p>
## Goal
The Engine you implement should allow a person to use its camera to control 3 parameters:

1. The position of the head in the image
2. The orientation of both arms extended to the sides

### Assumptions
You can assume the following:

* The captured scene is well lit
* The person's face is always showing
* The camera is physically stable
* The camera doesn't automatically alter exposure or gain
* The persons wears a shirt with short sleeves

## Technical Requirements

### Game
Python 2.7.x with the following packages:

1. numpy
2. opencv-python (version 2.4.9 - 2.4.12)
3. pygame

### Notebooks
The following packages:

1. ipython
2. jupyter
3. matplotlib
